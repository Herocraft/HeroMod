3:30 AM <unknownloner> anyways Kainzo use this https://github.com/unknownloner/HeroModServ to get rid of the dependance of heromod on my server
3:30 AM <unknownloner> I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out how to change the domain in the HeroMod source
3:30 AM <unknownloner> you need nodejs
3:30 AM <unknownloner> git clone the repo
3:30 AM <unknownloner> cd into the directory
3:31 AM <unknownloner> run 'npm install'
3:31 AM <unknownloner> and then to launch the server run 'node heromod_serv.js'
3:31 AM <unknownloner> in a screen of course, or however you wanna do it
3:31 AM <unknownloner> then you're good to go
